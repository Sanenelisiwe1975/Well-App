# 💡 Ideas & Continuous Improvement

Welcome to the Invoice/Receipt Extraction System improvement hub! This document outlines how we collect, prioritize, and implement ideas to make our system better.

## 🎯 Our Improvement Philosophy

We believe in community-driven development where real-world usage drives innovation. Every extraction failure is a learning opportunity, and every user suggestion helps us build a more robust system.

## 📝 How to Contribute Ideas

## 📊 Prioritization Process

### Monthly Triage Sessions
We hold monthly community triage sessions where we:

1. **Review new ideas** submitted in the past month
2. **Categorize and label** issues appropriately
3. **Assess impact and feasibility** using our scoring matrix
4. **Set priorities** for the upcoming development cycle

### Scoring Matrix
Each idea is evaluated on:
- **Impact**: How many users will benefit? (1-5)
- **Effort**: Development complexity and time required (1-5)
- **Alignment**: How well does it fit our roadmap? (1-5)
- **Community Interest**: Number of upvotes and comments (1-5)

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Security issues, major bugs affecting core functionality
- 🟠 **High**: Features with high impact and community demand
- 🟡 **Medium**: Valuable improvements with moderate effort
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice-to-have features or minor enhancements

## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

1. **Idea Submission** → GitHub Issues/Discussions
2. **Community Discussion** → Feedback and refinement
3. **Monthly Triage** → Categorization and prioritization
4. **Development Planning** → Assignment to milestones
5. **Implementation** → Development and testing
6. **Community Review** → Beta testing and feedback
7. **Release** → Deployment and documentation
