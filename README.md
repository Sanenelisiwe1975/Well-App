## Overview

**Well is the Chrome extension that becomes every founder’s best friend when accounting season hits.**

It automates supplier invoice retrieval and pipes the data directly into your accounting tools, ERP, or dashboards — with zero effort.

Built for founders, solo operators, and lean teams, Well replaces hours of repetitive clicking, dragging, chasing, and copy-pasting. What used to eat up days across tax seasons now takes one click.

At its core, Well is a **Chrome extension** that automates browser workflows on your behalf — boosting productivity when batch-retrieving invoices. You can also use it on the go: as you browse, Well catches invoices for you.

**Features include:**
- WhatsApp and email ingestion
- Google Drive and Slack integrations
- AI-generated workflow blueprints
- Self-healing automations that adapt to changes
- Multi-format export support (JSON, CSV, XML, UBL, QuickBooks, Xero)
- Built-in validation for invoice data integrity
- Extensible plugin system for custom formats
- Compatibility with e-invoicing standards including Factur-X and UBL 2.1

We believe invoice exchange should follow a universal protocol: instant, standardized, and automated. You shouldn’t have to think about it. With Well, you won’t.

## How It Works

### Basic Usage

```python
from exporters import get_exporter

# Get an exporter instance
exporter = get_exporter('json')  # or 'csv', 'xml', 'ubl', 'quickbooks', 'xero'

# Export data
data = {
    'invoice_number': 'INV-1234',
    'date': '2025-07-29',
    'amount': 199.99,
    'customer': 'Acme Corp',
    # ... other fields
}

exporter.export(data, 'invoice.json')
```

### Required Fields
All invoices must include these required fields:
- `invoice_number` (str): Unique identifier for the invoice
- `date` (str): Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `amount` (float): Total invoice amount (must be positive)
- `customer` (str): Name of the customer

1. **Browse our provider gallery**  
   Visit [wellapp.ai/providers](http://wellapp.ai/providers) to explore thousands of supported portals.

2. **Launch the Chrome extension**  
   Install and pin the extension. One click to launch invoice retrieval.

3. **Auto-detect invoices as you browse**  
   Well’s AI suggests retrieval when it sees a paid invoice.

4. **Batch-retrieve during tax season**  
   Run large-scale retrievals in a few clicks.

5. **Generate new blueprints with AI**  
   Use Contributor Mode to teach Well new workflows without code.

6. **Let it self-heal**  
   When a portal changes, Well adapts — no manual fixes needed.

## Extending Well

### Adding New Export Formats

1. Create a new Python file in the `exporters` directory
2. Create a class that inherits from `BaseExporter`
3. Implement the `_export` method
4. Add the `@ExporterFactory.register()` decorator

Example:

```python
from .base_exporter import BaseExporter
from .exporter_factory import ExporterFactory

@ExporterFactory.register("myformat")
class MyFormatExporter(BaseExporter):
    """Exports invoice data to MyFormat."""
    
    def _export(self, data: dict, output_path: str) -> None:
        with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"MyFormat: {data['invoice_number']}")
```
